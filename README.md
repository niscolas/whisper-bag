# Dev Thoughts

- To make iterations quicker, focused solely on the requirements, while leaving room for expansion (example: no item stacking since it wasn't mentioned but can easily hold more than 4 items)
- Didn't use external plugins besides UMG Viewmodel or features like Interfaces, GAS (Interaction?) or DataAssets, that would probably be overkill
